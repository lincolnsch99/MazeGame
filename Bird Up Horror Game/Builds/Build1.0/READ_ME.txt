Escape From Bird Version 0.3:

Changes : 
 - Better sound control.
 - Bird is done! Animations and everything.
 - Options menu and tutorial menu has been added.
 - Posted to itch.io.

Issues : 
 - I haven't run into the "running through walls" bug since the last version, but I won't assume that the bug is gone.

Plans : 
 - If anyone is actually interested, I'll make updates, otherwise not much planned.
