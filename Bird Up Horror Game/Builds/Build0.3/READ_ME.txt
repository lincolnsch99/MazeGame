Escape From Bird Version 0.3:

Changes : 
 - Pause menu added. Player can either resume, go back to main menu, or quit the application.
 - Timer added. Can be changed in the custom difficulty settings.
 - Added UI elements to keep track of stamina and rocks found.
 - Once all the rocks are found, victory screen is displayed and then you go back to the main menu.
 - If the bird catches you, or you run out of time, death screen is displayed and you go back to the main menu.

Issues : 
 - I haven't run into the "running through walls" bug since the last version, but I won't assume that the bug is gone.

Plans : 
 - Larger maps need to be harder. The AI currently goes around to random positions until it gets close to the player, so it is quite
possible that the player could go the entire game without ever seeing the enemy. 
 - Tried to update the walls, but it just made it actually worse. Instead I will implement grass or puddles or something like that.
 - STILL need to finish the bird model. This is probably last priority (and it isn't fun).
